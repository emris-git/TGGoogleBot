There are several steps to initialize your service.

1. Go to https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/dotnet?hl=ru 
and click "Enable the Google Calendar API". Next choose "Desktop app" and then download your credentials. 
Insert them into your app folder.

2. Text @BotFather in the telegram and send him /newbot. After several steps get your token.

3. Insert your token and your google email into appsetting.json. (secrets better)

4. Run it!

If you want to publish your app don't forget that your token from telegram and credentials.json are private.
Don't show them to other people.
